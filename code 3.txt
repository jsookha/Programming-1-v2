Problem Solving - 6 steps 
Algorithmic / Heuristic 
Variables & Constants - v can change / const once delared - must be given a value - and cannot change

Operators ()

intResult = (A + B) / R * 4 - 2 + (A / E)
 
Relational = <= > >= < <>

blnResult = (A + 3) >= C
blnResult = A <> B 
blnResult = 1 <> 2 
blnResult = "John" <> "Joan"
blnResult = "J" <> "K" 
blnResult = "J" == "G" 

Opposites

and vice versa 
 
Logical NOT AND OR ! && ||
blnR = NOT C 	-----if C is true - the blnR is false and vice versa 
blnR = A AND B	-----
blnR = A OR B 

Modules ... Procedures Functions Methods 
Parameters - call by reference - call by value 


Sequential Logic 
Decision Logic 
	If then 
	conditions - Age <> 999 
	Multiple If then statements 
	Nested If then statements - Positive Logic / Negative Logic 
Loop Logic 
	Repeat Until ... post condition (do while)
	While do ... pre condition 
	For loop ... automatic counter loop

	flag, sentinel value, indicator  
Case Logic 
	Switch / Case statement 

Arrays 
	1 dimensional arrays 
	multiple arrays - parallel arrays 
	2 dimensional arrays 

	Search - sequential search, binary search 
	Sort - bubble sort, selection exchange, and all the other weird ones that exist 

-------------------------------
Start 
1. Read Age

2. sum = 0 
3. count = 0  

4. While Age <> 999 
	sum = sum + Age 
	count = count + 1 
	Read Age 
   End While 

5. Average = sum / count 
6. Print Average 

7. End
