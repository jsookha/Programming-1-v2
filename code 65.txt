/*
 got the link to the code above from 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/javaexamples/comments/336epj/getting_input_from_the_console_validating_and/

 take note of the code - its not perfect - just an idea - a possbility 
 read through this code and do a little of your own research from the link provided and research 
 into the code 

 remember that the while loop used in the above code is mainly for the running through the cells 
 in the array ... you will notice why I am saying this - when you visit the link and see that a 
 while loop is used for a different purpose
