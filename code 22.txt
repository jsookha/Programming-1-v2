Program: 	loop structure - while loop  
Programmer: 	J.Sookha 
Description: 	while loop to repeat code - the logic is quite important 
		here - take note of what code is placed in what order

//3 different kinds of loops - While loop, Repeat..Until loop and For loop 

// incrementing - adding by a constant -- intCount = intCount + 1 -- 1 is that constant 

// accumulating - adding by aq value  -- dblSum = dblSum + intAge -- intAge is that value 

//initialize what ??? inc acc 

// while (intAge != 999) // loop is based on a sentinel value that will decide if it must end or not 
// while (intCount <= 30) // loop is based on an indicator - same concept as above with a different purpose 
// while (blnFlag == true) // loop is based on a flag - a value that will decide to continue or not
