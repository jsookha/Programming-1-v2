6. Barnhill Fastener Company runs a small factory. The company employs workers who
   are paid one of three hourly rates depending on skill level:
	Skill Level 	Hourly Pay Rate ($)
	1 		17.00
	2 		20.00
	3 		22.00

   Each factory worker might work any number of hours per week; any hours over 40
   are paid at one and one-half times the usual rate.

   In addition, workers in skill levels 2 and 3 can elect the following insurance options:
	Option 	Explanation 			Weekly Cost to Employee ($)
	1 	Medical insurance 		32.50
	2 	Dental insurance 		20.00
	3 	Long-term disability insurance 	10.00

   Also, workers in skill level 3 can elect to participate in the retirement plan at 3% of
   their gross pay.

   Write an interactive Java payroll application that calculates the net pay for a factory
   worker. The program prompts the user for skill level and hours worked, as well as
   appropriate insurance and retirement options for the employee’s skill level category.
   The application displays: 
   (1) the hours worked, 
   (2) the hourly pay rate, 
   (3) the regular pay for 40 hours, 
   (4) the overtime pay, 
   (5) the total of regular and overtime pay, and
   (6) the total itemized deductions. If the deductions exceed the gross pay, display an
       error message; otherwise, calculate and display 
   (7) the net pay after all the deductions have been subtracted from the gross. 
   Save the file as Pay.java.
