Program: 	Datatypes and Printing 
Programmer: 	J.Sookha 
Description: 	showcasing the various data types and being able to print in the Console
		window - Compared to the textbook - we run our programs inside of Netbeans
		- so when we run our programs - we see the execution inside of the Output 
		window that is within Netbeans - if we followed the instructions in the textbook
		- we would then be running our program inside what we call the "Command Prompt" 
		window
